This is a simple language that provides HAML-like syntax, but for non-HTML
files. Thus: non-HAML.

General usage:

```ruby
require 'non-haml'
NonHaml.generate outfile_name, infile_name, {local_var1: 3, other_var: "something"}
```

In previous versions, the third argument was allowed to be a `Binding`. This is
no longer allowed, and you should instead pass in an (optional) hash of local
variables.
